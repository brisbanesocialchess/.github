You can set your membership in the Brisbane Social Chess GitHub Organization to `Public` on the
[People](https://github.com/orgs/brisbanesocialchess/people) page when logged in.

Please show your support for your new team 🏢 🧑🏽‍💻 💃 😎 🚀

If you are a `private` organization member, the public including everyone else that is not in
the team won't see that you are part of Brisbane Social Chess.

After joining by default you are listed as a private member. You can then check your GitHub
profile or the Brisbane Social Chess organization profile in a private tab or incognito
window and you will see that your organization is not listed on your profile and
that your avatar does not show on the Brisbane Social Chess organization homepage or
people page.

Your choice. Thanks once again !! ❤️
